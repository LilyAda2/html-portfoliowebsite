<h1>The Best Bollywood Movies According to Lily Ada</h1>
<h2>My top 4 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Jawan</h3>
<p>
  Recently released in the last quarter of last year 2023, I will give the first
  one to Jawan because i still keep remembering the scenes in this movie. I love
  the action-packed vfx and most especially Mr.Khan.
</p>
<h3>My name is Khan</h3>
<p>
  Really inspirational movie. Love the dialogue: 'My name is Khan and I'm not a
  Terrorist'.
</p>
<h3>Three Idiots</h3>
<p>
  Love how the movie teaches us about the society as a whole, it's shortcomings.
  Love the comedy and music too.
</p>
<h3>Yeh Vaada Raha</h3>
<p>
  I still keep watching this ever green movie - 'The Promose'. Though the movie
  didn't do well in India at that time (in the 80s) but for me it was a hit.
  Very emotional and romantic movie.<br />
  One of my first introduction to Bollywood movie in the 80s.
